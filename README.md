# Description
Hello
This tool may not give you the correct answer in the first step of the test. It is recommended that you try the tool again after the initial run.


This tool runs after entering the password of the list, first scans and finds all Wi-Fi and just enter the desired Wi-Fi number.


After running the program, just give the password list name to the program so that the password list file is in the tool path to work properly for you.
The system beeps after your device password is found by your system

You can create a list password in the application file and enter its name
